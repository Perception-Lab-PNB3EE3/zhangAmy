	abstract = {Purpose We empirically evaluated learning and retention of information presented in a podcast at various speeds. Furthermore, we examined individual differences among learners by evaluating whether the audio-only format is better suited for learners with strong auditory processing abilities.
Methods Sixty-one students from two medical schools were randomly assigned to listen to a Behind the Knife podcast on prophylactic mesh placement at one of three listening speeds: 1x, 1.5x, and 1.75x. Auditory working memory capacity (AWMC) was measured with an auditory digit span test. Students completed a 20-question multiple choice and short-answer quiz immediately following the podcast and again 6–9 days later.
Results When adjusting for AWMC, there was a significant difference among listening speed groups (p = 0.032). Pairwise comparisons showed that participants in the 1 × condition scored significantly better on the immediate test than participants in the 1.5 × (p = 0.05) and 1.75 × (p = 0.01) conditions. Further analyses confirmed the aptitude-treatment interaction by showing that listening to the podcast at any increased speed was detrimental to performance on the immediate test (p= 0.01) and retention test (p = 0.02). This was especially true for individuals with lower AWMC. Individuals with an AWMC score below 6.14 were more likely to score below the median on the immediate comprehension test.
Conclusion Individuals with lower AWMC have decreased comprehension of accelerated audio content. Students can use the AWMC instrument to gauge their own auditory processing ability, so they can direct their study methods.},

	abstract = {We presented participants with lecture videos at different speeds and tested immediate and delayed (1 week) comprehension. Results revealed minimal costs incurred by increasing video speed from 1x to 1.5x or 2x speed, but performance declined beyond 2x speed. We also compared learning outcomes after watching videos once at 1x or twice at 2x speed. There was not an advantage to watching twice at 2x speed but if participants watched the video again at 2x speed immediately before the test, compared to watching once at 1x a week before the test, comprehension improved. Thus, increasing the speed of videos (up to 2x) may be an efficient strategy, especially if students use the time saved for additional studying or rewatching the videos, but learners should do this additional studying shortly before an exam. However, these trends may differ for videos with different speech rates, complexity or difficulty, and audiovisual overlap.},

	abstract = {This study examined how three auditory lectures delivered at different speeds – normal (1.0x), fast (1.5x) and very fast (3.0x) speeds – affected the graduate students’ attention, cognitive load, and learning that were assessed by pre- and post-comprehension tests, cognitive-load questionnaire, and Electroencephalography (EEG) device. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the students’ attention, cognitive load, and learning performance between the normal (1.0x) and 1.5x speed. However, when the auditory lecture speed reached three times of its original speed (3.0x), the students’ comprehension scores were significantly lower both in the immediate and (one-week) delayed recall tests, than those in the other two speed conditions. When listening to the lecture at the 3.0x speed, the learners had a higher level of attention and cognitive load. The study provided insights for teaching, instructional design, and learning.},

	abstract = {Recorded lectures represent a popular means of delivering educational content. These lectures afford increasing the playback speed which could be used to reduce time demands and increase the likelihood that a lecture is consumed. In two experiments (N ¼ 320), we examined the impact of increasing the playback speed of lectures across a range of speeds on memory for the lecture material, mind wandering, and the learner’s experience of the lecture. For speeds up until 2x, findings revealed no significant differences in memory for the material, mind wandering, and learner’s subjective experience of the lecture, with the exception that “enjoyment of speed” decreased as speed increased. Beyond a speed of 2x, however, significant impairments in memory for the lecture material and decreases in liking toward both the video lecture and the speed were observed. Moreover, the increase in mind wandering with time on task often observed in recorded lectures was not modulated by lecture playback speed. These results reinforce extant results in the literature on the effects of increasing playback speed on memory for lecture material and add new insights in terms of this strategy’s influence on mind wandering and learner’s subjective experience of the lecture.},

	abstract = {The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) is a computer-based go/no-go task to measure neurocognitive function in older adults. However, simpliﬁed average features of this complex dataset lead to loss of primary information and fail to express associations between test performance and clinically meaningful outcomes. Here, we combine a novel method to visualise individual trial (raw) information obtained from the SART test in a large population-based study of ageing in Ireland and an automatic clustering technique. We employed a thresholding method, based on the individual trial number of mistakes, to identify poorer SART performances and a fuzzy clusters algorithm to partition the dataset into 3 subgroups, based on the evolution of SART performance after 4 years. Raw SART data were available for 3468 participants aged 50 years and over at baseline. The previously reported SART visualisation-derived feature ‘bad performance’, indicating the number of SART trials with at least 4 mistakes, and its evolution over time, combined with the fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm, individuated 3 clusters corresponding to 3 degrees of physiological dysregulation. The biggest cluster (94\% of the cohort) was constituted by healthy participants, a smaller cluster (5\% of the cohort) by participants who showed improvement in cognitive and psychological status, and the smallest cluster (1\% of the cohort) by participants whose mobility and cognitive functions dramatically declined after 4 years. We were able to identify in a cohort of relatively high-functioning community-dwelling adults a very small group of participants who showed clinically signiﬁcant decline. The selected smallest subset manifested not only mobility deterioration, but also cognitive decline, the latter being usually hard to detect in population-based studies. The employed techniques could identify at-risk participants with more speciﬁcity than current methods, and help clinicians better identify and manage the small proportion of community-dwelling older adults who are at signiﬁcant risk of functional decline and loss of independence.},

	abstract = {Psychological research is increasingly moving online, where web-based studies allow for data collection at scale. Behavioural researchers are well supported by existing tools for participant recruitment, and for building and running experiments with decent timing. However, not all techniques are portable to the Internet: While eye tracking works in tightly controlled lab conditions, webcam-based eye tracking suffers from high attrition and poorer quality due to basic limitations like webcam availability, poor image quality, and reflections on glasses and the cornea. Here we present MouseView.js, an alternative to eye tracking that can be employed in web-based research. Inspired by the visual system, MouseView.js blurs the display to mimic peripheral vision, but allows participants to move a sharp aperture that is roughly the size of the fovea. Like eye gaze, the aperture can be directed to fixate on stimuli of interest. We validated MouseView.js in an online replication (N = 165) of an established free viewing task (N = 83 existing eye-tracking datasets), and in an in-lab direct comparison with eye tracking in the same participants (N = 50). Mouseview.js proved as reliable as gaze, and produced the same pattern of dwell time results. In addition, dwell time differences from MouseView.js and from eye tracking correlated highly, and related to self-report measures in similar ways. The tool is opensource, implemented in JavaScript, and usable as a standalone library, or within Gorilla, jsPsych, and PsychoJS. In sum, MouseView.js is a freely available instrument for attention-tracking that is both reliable and valid, and that can replace eye tracking in certain web-based psychological experiments.},
