# Project Title
Web-based reaction time experiments
## Descriptions
This folder contains the code and stimuli for two version of a web-based reaction time task. 

Participants will see one of two stimuli appear on screen. They are instructed to press one key for one stimulus and a different key for the other. Their reaction time for key pressing is recorded and given as debrief at the end of the experiment, along with accuracy rate. 
Each experiment consists of 10 trials. 
## Running the Experiments
* Both experiments are built using jsPsych plugins and requires the plugins to be downloaded to the experimentor's local devices. All jsPsych plugins can be found in the "jspsych" repository.
* The stimuli used in both experiments can be found in the "img" repository. The images also need to be downloaded to the experimenters' local devices.
